Portafolio assignment


Programming my own website has truly been a big challenge, as it made me realize that I still have a lot to understand, but at the same time, I managed to grasp several concepts better. Particularly, optimizing it for different screen sizes and arranging elements was quite a task. I also found the use of Bootstrap a bit confusing. Nevertheless, I believe that I have made progress each day.
